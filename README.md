# Sorts

## What is this project?

In this repo I've made some basic sorting algorithms. So far these are just in Javascript for my own edification but I plan to add more languages as I continue. Right now there are:

* [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
* [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

This is the way I've chosen to use up some of my free time so that it feels like I'm being productive even though I'm just sorting things.

Each program by default will generate a 10 integer list of random numbers from 1-100 and sort that list. These values can be altered using flags at run time to generate a different length list or another range of values.


## Usage

You can download and run these files on your own computer if you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your local system. 

Syntax to run each is:

    node <filename>.js
